At first, I was on the original Seasonique - I had to switch to the Lo Seasonique because with the original, I had the worst cramping, moodiness, bleeding, ever. I thought the lower strength would be the perfect pill for me. Boy, was I ever wrong. I haven&#039;t had a regular period yet, and I have been taking this medication for over a year. I bleed an average of 21 days - I am period-free one week, and then have a full-brown cycle for five days. The 3-month period-free thing sounded so good - especially because I usually miss work or class because of horrible periods, but this was very counterproductive.
